    "Python was made for ease of use and has since become an essential tool for different kinds of people: programmers, engineers, researchers, and data scientists across academia and industry. The reason why it's widely used is because of its large ecosystem and the availability of domain-specific libraries that have been built using it. It can do so much that you can practically do almost any computer-related tasks such as creating web applications, desktop applications, video games, robots, and also doing data analysis. "
